## Conclusion

In this article, we introduced decoupled Web forms considered as three parts by creating a Declarative Form Description Pipeline (DFDP).
The implementations of the FormRenderer and FormCli prove that the display part is loosely coupled to the rendering environment.
The FormGenerator shows how such declarative form descriptions can be produced.
For developers this means that they can use the same description for multiple viewing environments, as RDF describes the what and not the how, and we proved that the UI ontologies are not tied to HTML.
We also provided them with tools they can build further upon to learn how to do so.

Developers and researchers can use the FormRenderer tool to generate and insert data into a defined shape as specified by the form description.
This reduces the risk of errors in data entry as users are only required to input raw data into the app's user interface.

By using the DFDP, form developers can more quickly build new forms than before by reusing existing forms instead of starting from scratch.
Additionally, by extending on existing ontologies for describing forms like Solid-UI and SHACL, there is no need for developers to start over again to use the DFDP.
They can reuse existing form descriptions and extend it with footprint tasks, rather making it an extra step to more possibilities.
To help developers perform this extra step, they can reuse the code as part of this research to execute the policies.
This allows them to quickly start performing user defined actions on filled in data.

Schema alignment enables developers to use data in their app written in any ontology that is semantically equivalent to some app vocabulary.
As a result, it is now easier for developers to use existing data of other apps using this technology.
Form renderer developers can use the form descriptions generated by third-party form generators as everything down to the expected actions is described in that description.
Additionally, this also means that these developers can reuse form descriptions that users are using with other form renderers.
The DFDP makes it easier for developers and researchers to substitute one app in the pipeline with another without the need to also reimplement the other app.
Furthermore, existing form descriptions can still be used, making it easier for end-users to switch apps and adopt new versions, and for developers to publish new apps.
Researchers can more easily build upon existing apps to extend them with new technologies in their future research.

Such future research could focus on automatically suggesting bindings based on field names entered by the users.
Other directions for future work could include streamlining the schema alignment and footprint tasks to make them more abstract for developers.
Embedding schema alignment as a layer between the app and the data would enable developers to automatically consider semantically equivalent ontologies as the same, resulting in real interoperability without extra work for the developers.
